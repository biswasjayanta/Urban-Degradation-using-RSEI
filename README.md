Urban Environmental Degradation in Bangladesh: Insights from a Weighted Entropy Ecological Index

Rapid urbanization and increasing human-environment interaction have significantly contributed to environmental degradation, particularly in developing countries. Urban areas are losing their blue-green spaces, resulting in urban heat island effects, biodiversity loss, and declining ecological health. To address this urgency, practical techniques to quantify and detect environmental changes are needed. This study introduces a weighted entropy-based Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) model, which incorporates all key environmental variables, including water bodies, overcoming the limitation of traditional PCA-based approaches. The model was applied to 12 city corporations in Bangladesh to analyze spatiotemporal environmental conditions from 2016 to 2024 using Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data. Results indicate a consistent decline in environmental quality across most city corporations, with RSEI values ranging from 0.489 to 0.713 in 2016 and declining to 0.485 to 0.596 by 2024. Chattogram, Cumilla, and Mymensing initially showed good environmental conditions but degraded over time. Conversely, environmental conditions temporarily improved during the COVID-19 pandemic before deteriorating again. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed increasing urban sprawl, contributing to the randomness of RSEI values over time. This study demonstrates that the weighted entropy RSEI model effectively monitors urban environmental changes and provides actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers to mitigate environmental degradation and promote sustainable urban development.
